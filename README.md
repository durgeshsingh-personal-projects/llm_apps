Crafting an AI-Powered HR Assistant: A Use Case for Nestlé’s HR Policy Documents

Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays important role in Digital transformation. As part of its
ongoing digital transformation initiatives, Nestlé explored the integration of generative AI to
improve employee access to Human Resources (HR) policy information. A key challenge
was the complexity and volume of HR documentation, which often led to delays in
information retrieval and inconsistent employee experiences. To address this, I developed
an AI-powered HR Assistant trained specifically on Nestlé’s internal HR policy
documents.

Problem Statement
Employees frequently struggled to find accurate answers to HR-related questions—
ranging from hiring processes to performance appraisals to career growth, people
management, trade unions, international policy—despite the existence of comprehensive
internal documentation. Traditional search systems were limited in natural language
understanding and required exact keyword matches, leading to inefficiencies and repeated
queries to HR personnel.
